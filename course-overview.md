# Introduction to Web Programming

Welcome to Web Programming I! In this class, you will learn the essential skills for building modern web applications. Instead of passively watching slides, you will actively build, experiment, and explore each feature through hands-on coding and real examples. Each topic folder in this repository contains practical exercises and sample code. As you progress, you’ll gain experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, forms, templates, databases, and more.

## How This Class Works

You will learn by doing. Each topic is a mini-project or set of exercises designed to teach you a specific concept or skill. You’ll read code, write code, and see immediate results in your browser. By the end of the course, you’ll have a portfolio of working web applications and a deep understanding of how the web works.
